![App Icon](/src-tauri/icons/128x128.png)

Are you tired of having to manually fill shares. Well this project has you covered. You can check list of open shares, fill one for multiple users on one click and come back and view the results and much more.

## How to download?

Download the installer from the releases section on the sidebar. Browsers may give you a hard time downloading the app, since this isn't a signed yet, so you may have to click `keep anyway` to download & `install anyway` to install the app.

## Data Security?

All the data is stored locally and there are no api calls happening except the ones to meroshare.
